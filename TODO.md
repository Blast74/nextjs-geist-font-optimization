- [x] Add visual styling directly in XAML.
- [x] Ensure no external icons or images are used.
- [x] Instantiate `MeasurementService` and `GraphicsRenderer`.
- [x] Wire up event handlers for button clicks and key events.
- [x] Call the appropriate service methods to compute new results on user interaction.
- [x] Use try-catch blocks to log and display friendly error messages.
- [x] Implement methods to read user inputs and compute results.
- [x] Handle exceptions and return error status to the UI.
- [x] Develop methods to draw measurement frames, target markers, and spectral curves.
- [x] Map data values to canvas coordinates.
- [x] Ensure the drawing routines gracefully update.
