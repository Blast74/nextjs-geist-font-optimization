# Implementation Plan for C# Graphical Application

## Project Structure and Key Components
- **MainWindow.xaml & MainWindow.xaml.cs**  
- **MeasurementService.cs**  
- **GraphicsRenderer.cs**  
- **DataModel.cs**  
- **Utility.cs**  

## Step-by-Step File Changes

### MainWindow.xaml
- [ ] Create a responsive Grid layout with two main regions: Left Panel and Right Panel.
- [ ] Add visual styling directly in XAML.
- [ ] Ensure no external icons or images are used.

### MainWindow.xaml.cs
- [ ] Instantiate `MeasurementService` and `GraphicsRenderer`.
- [ ] Wire up event handlers for button clicks and key events.
- [ ] Call the appropriate service methods to compute new results on user interaction.
- [ ] Use try-catch blocks to log and display friendly error messages.

### MeasurementService.cs
- [ ] Implement methods to read user inputs and compute results.
- [ ] Handle exceptions and return error status to the UI.

### GraphicsRenderer.cs
- [ ] Develop methods to draw measurement frames, target markers, and spectral curves.
- [ ] Map data values to canvas coordinates.
- [ ] Ensure the drawing routines gracefully update.

### DataModel.cs
- [ ] Create classes for parameters and results with public properties.
- [ ] Implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` for real-time UI updates.
- [ ] Validate data within property setters.

### Utility.cs
- [ ] Define helper methods for coordinate mapping and conversions.

## Additional Considerations
- [ ] Ensure clear UX and accessibility.
- [ ] Integrate unit tests to verify computations and renderings.
- [ ] Follow SOLID principles and separate concerns.
- [ ] Centralize logging and exception management.

## Summary
- A new WPF C# project will be created with a modern layout.
- MainWindow will host input fields and a drawing canvas.
- MeasurementService will implement the original QuickBasic logic.
- GraphicsRenderer will translate drawing commands into WPF shapes.
- DataModel and Utility classes will support state management and conversions.
- The UI design will emphasize clear typography and responsive error messaging.
